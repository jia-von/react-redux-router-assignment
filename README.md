# React-Redux Calculator Assignment With React Router

This assignment is meant to challenge myself with the knowledge of state, prop and element rendering in React while also using a store in redux to store information. Redux is often used as a companion to React, and is favored for storing information over using state. React Router is used to create multiple pages in React, and is often used to keep applications and web pages organized.
